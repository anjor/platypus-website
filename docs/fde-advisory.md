# FDE Advisory

**Build a world-class Forward Deployed Engineering organization.**

You've heard about FDEs. Maybe from Palantir's success stories, or [The Pragmatic Engineer's deep dive](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/forward-deployed-engineers), or from watching AI companies scale with FDE-first models.

Now you want to build one. But where do you start?

---

## The Challenge

Most FDE programs fail because organizations:

**Hire wrong.** Standard engineering interviews miss FDE-critical traits: pain tolerance, ownership mindset, learning velocity, and client-facing capability.

**Structure wrong.** Unclear ownership between FDE and Product teams creates friction that kills deployments.

**Enable wrong.** Products that aren't FDE-ready force engineers to spend 70% of their time fighting internal systems instead of solving customer problems.

## What We Offer

### FDE Hiring System Design

**Design a hiring process that actually identifies great FDEs.**

Most companies fail at FDE hiring because they use standard engineering interviews. We build hiring systems that test for what matters:

- **Hiring thesis framework** — Document rationale for every hire
- **Custom interview rounds** — Learning & Reengineering, Decomposition, behavioral assessments
- **Evaluation scorecards** — Calibrated rubrics for FDE-specific traits
- **Interviewer training** — Calibrate your team on what good looks like

**Deliverables:** Interview process design, question bank, scorecards, interviewer training materials.

### FDE Organizational Design

**Structure your FDE org for success from day one.**

We help you answer the hard questions:

- How should FDEs and Product teams work together?
- What ownership boundaries prevent friction?
- How do you build culture around radical ownership?
- How do you measure FDE performance?

**Deliverables:** Org structure recommendation, operating model, FDE-Product interface agreement, metrics framework.

---

### Interviewing as a Service
