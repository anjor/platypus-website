## Strategic Partnership

**FDE Organization Building**  
Design and implement Palantir-style forward deployed engineering organizations. We help you structure teams around customer outcomes, define operating models, and build the culture of ownership that makes FDEs effective.

**Hiring System Design**  
End-to-end hiring process design tailored to your company's needs. From defining core traits to building interview kits to training your team. You own the system forever.

**Fractional CTO / Technical Advisory**  
Strategic guidance for technical decisions, architecture choices, and engineering leadership. Especially valuable for teams working with Palantir Foundry or navigating complex technical transformations.

## Hands-On Delivery

When strategic advice isn't enough, we build:

- **Generative AI Applications**: LLM-based products, fine-tuning pipelines, evaluation frameworks
- **Blockchain Development**: Smart contracts, data archival systems, Web3 infrastructure
- **Palantir Foundry Implementation**: Custom applications, data pipelines, production deployments
- **Computational Physics**: Simulation development, numerical methods, scientific computing

Recent work: [Rebuilding gyrokinetics simulations with AI](https://anjor.xyz/writing/2025/11/05/testing-the-intelligence-explosion-can-ai-turn-one-physicist-into-a-research-team/)—testing intelligence explosion through active research.

## Interviewing as a Service

On-demand expert interview capacity to scale your hiring without draining your engineers.

**What's included:**
- Technical and behavioral interviews conducted by our Palantir/Google-trained team
- Detailed candidate reports with clear hire/no-hire recommendations
- 24-hour turnaround

## Why These Services Together?

Building great technical organizations requires three things:

1. **The right people** — Elite hiring systems that actually work
2. **The right structure** — Organizations that align around outcomes, not org charts
3. **Technical credibility** — Leaders who can still code, still architect, still debug production

Most consultancies offer one. Almost none understand all three. We've lived it at Palantir, Protocol Labs, and our own ventures.

We're not ex-engineers advising from the sidelines. We're current practitioners who understand organizational design.
