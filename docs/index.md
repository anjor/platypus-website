## Hiring & Talent Systems

**The Hiring Blueprint**
> End-to-end hiring process design tailored to your company's needs

Ideal for early-stage teams (Seed - Series B) who need to build a repeatable hiring process from scratch.

**What's included:**

- Discovery & traits workshop: Define core attributes of success at your company
- Role definition & job descriptions that actually attract great people
- End-to-end interview process designed to test for your specific traits
- Custom interview kits: questions, technical challenges, scorecards
- Interviewer calibration: hands-on training to align your team

**Case studies:**

- [Comand AI](https://anjor.xyz/writing/2024/09/28/comand-ai-a-hiring-case-study/): Designed hiring for mission-driven engineers

**Interviewing as a Service (IaaS)**
> On-demand expert interview capacity to scale your hiring without draining your engineers

**Embedded Hiring Partner**
> Strategic partnership to build, lead, and execute your entire technical hiring function

Ideal for well-funded startups building a core team of 5-10+ engineers quickly and correctly, needing senior leadership without the full-time executive cost.

**What's included:**

- Full strategic oversight: Acting as your fractional Head of Talent / VP of Engineering for hiring

## FDE & Organizational Strategy

!!! info "Dedicated FDE Advisory Page"
    
    **[View our complete FDE advisory offering →](fde-advisory.md)**
    
    Includes hiring system design, organizational design, Interviewing as a Service, and free resources.

Design and implement Palantir-style FDE organizations from scratch. We help you:

- Structure teams around customer outcomes, not org charts
- Define the operating model that makes FDEs effective
- Build the culture of radical ownership
- Hire and onboard FDEs who can thrive in the model

This is the model that made Palantir successful. We spent 7 years as FDEs and know how to transplant it to other organizations.

## AI Strategy & Adoption

![The Autonomy Gradient](./assets/autonomy-gradient.png){ width="700" }

**AI Implementation Strategy**

Most companies are experimenting with AI without a clear framework for what works. We help you:

- Understand where AI amplifies expertise vs where it fails (the autonomy gradient)
- Design validation methodologies for AI-generated outputs
- Build AI-assisted workflows that increase productivity
- Evaluate AI tools and platforms for your use case

Based on hands-on research: We rebuilt 3,500 lines of physics simulation code in 21 days using AI, documented everything, and published the [findings](https://github.com/anjor/gandalf-paper). We know what AI can and can't do because we've tested the limits.

**Technical Delivery**

When strategy isn't enough, we build:

- LLM applications and fine-tuning pipelines
- AI evaluation frameworks
- Proof-of-concept implementations

**Recent work:**

- [Metaview](https://metaview.ai): Built data asset for LLM fine-tuning and automated job description generation
- [Catena Labs](https://www.catena.xyz/): Developed libraries to benchmark and deploy LLM ensembles
- [Radiant AI](https://www.radiantai.com/): Designed LLM-based applications demonstrating governance capabilities

## Why These Services Together?

Building great technical organizations requires three things:

1. **The right people** — Elite hiring systems that actually work
2. **The right structure** — Organizations that align around outcomes, not org charts
3. **Technical credibility** — Leaders who can still code, still architect, still debug production

We're not ex-engineers advising from the sidelines. We're current practitioners who understand organizational design.
