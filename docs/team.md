## Our Bench

For Interviewing as a Service and larger engagements, we work with a carefully curated bench of senior engineers, all trained in Palantir-style interviewing:

- **Ex-Palantir FDEs** with 5+ years of technical interviewing experience
- **Ex-Google/Amazon engineers** with hiring manager experience
- **Domain specialists** for specific technical areas

All bench members are calibrated to our standards and provide structured, detailed candidate assessments.
